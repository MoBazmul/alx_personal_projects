# NOUGHTS AND CROSSES
 - Noughts and crosses is a simple game that i created using C programming language which depicts the tic-tac-toe game. The game needs two players, a human player that decisively make the moves and the computer that automatically make its moves randomly.
 - The game is easy for the player to win because the computer does not make any defensive move against the player.

 ## How to modify the game and code
 - Write code to make the computer's moves more decisively/defensive.
 - The menu function calls itself twice instead of only one time for choices of operations, figure out the problem and help solve it.
 - Create code that can read more than one line from a file (load_scores func).
